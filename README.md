# Golang Code

This repository contains a Golang code that demonstrates the use of variables, formatting, mathematical concepts, logical operators, control flow statements, and loops.

## Getting Started

To run the code, you will need to have Go installed on your computer. Once you have Go installed, you can run the code by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
3. Run the following command:


go run main.go


This will compile and run the code.

## Code Explanation

The code starts by declaring some variables. The variables are declared using the `var` keyword. The values of the variables are then assigned using the `:=` operator.

The code then uses the `fmt` package to format and print the values of the variables. The `fmt` package provides a number of functions for formatting text and printing it to the console.

The code then demonstrates the use of mathematical concepts, logical operators, control flow statements, and loops.
